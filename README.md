# astrosphere.cpp
#### an astrosphere problem generator written by Greg Szypko for Athena++

These files were created as part of my undergraduate senior thesis in Physics at Dartmouth College. This project was advised by Prof. Hans-Reinhard Müller.

## Setting up Athena++
To use this problem generator first requires a working installation of *Athena++*, which can be found at https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena-public-version. More detailed installation information can be found in the accompanying wiki, but we will summarize the steps here.

1. Download the full athena-public-version/ directory to your machine
2. Ensure that your machine has a C++ compiler and Python 2.7+ or Python 3.4+. These are required for compilation and configuration of Athena++, respectively.
3. The following are optional, but were used in the span of my project:
